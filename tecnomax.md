# Tecnomax Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involved analyzing sales performance across multiple stores to identify top products, store performance, and seasonal trends.

**Objective**: Provide insights for optimized decision-making around inventory and sales.

**Key Components**:
- **Data Model**: Built a relational model connecting stores, products, and sales data.
- **Data Manipulation**: Used calculated columns for revenue metrics and data transformations for cleaner analysis.

## Data Model
The data used in this project was stored across three CSV files, each representing a separate year of sales data. These files were combined and cleaned to form a comprehensive dataset, connecting information from stores, products, and individual sales.

It also features a bar graph displaying the most sold products, layered with an income metric line for comparative analysis. Another bar graph highlights the most demanded categories, also paired with the income metric line to emphasize profitability.*

### 3. Store Comparison

*This dashboard presents an in-depth look at individual store performance with four bar graphs: total sales by store, top-performing salespeople, product availability per store, and the number of active sellers at each location. Each store is represented consistently with the same color across all graphs, making it easy to identify patterns and compare performance metrics*

### 4. Customer Insights
