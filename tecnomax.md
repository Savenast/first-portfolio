# Tecnomax sale Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involved analyzing sales performance across multiple stores to identify top products, store performance, and seasonal trends.

**Objective**: Provide insights for optimized decision-making around inventory and sales.

**Key Components**:
- **Data Model**: Built a relational model connecting stores, products, and sales data.
- **Data Manipulation**: Used calculated columns for revenue metrics and data transformations for cleaner analysis.

## Data Model
The data used in this project was stored across three CSV files, each representing a separate year of sales data. These files were combined and cleaned to form a comprehensive dataset, connecting information from stores, products, and individual sales.
